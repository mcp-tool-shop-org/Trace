# Trace

Deterministic cursor discipline game — precision, control, and composure under chaos.

Built on .NET 10 MAUI (Windows-first), with a fully deterministic fixed-timestep simulation, a five-state motion state machine, and a parametric visual identity driven entirely by simulation state.

Trace is not an aim trainer. Trace is not an arcade game. Mastery looks calm.

## Architecture

Four-module modular monolith. No cycles, no platform leakage into libraries.

```
MouseTrainer.Domain        --> (nothing)          Shared primitives, RNG, run identity, motion states
MouseTrainer.Simulation    --> Domain             Deterministic loop, modes, mutators, replay system
MouseTrainer.Audio         --> Domain             Cue system, asset verification
MouseTrainer.MauiHost      --> all three          Composition root, MAUI platform host, renderer
```

See [`docs/modular.manifesto.md`](docs/modular.manifesto.md) for the full dependency graph and constitutional rules.

## Motion State Machine

Trace inhabits exactly one of five motion states every frame:

| State | Identity | Visual |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Alignment** | Neutral, stable, calm | Baseline cyan, minimal glow |
| **Commitment** | Decisive acceleration | Slight forward tint, warm edge |
| **Resistance** | Counterforce lean | Amber-shifted edge, increased glow |
| **Correction** | Micro-adjustments | Edge brightening, high precision |
| **Recovery** | Brief recoil | Desaturation fade (150ms) |

Transitions are enforced by a compile-time transition table. Forbidden transitions return null.

```
Main loop:     Alignment → Commitment → Resistance → Correction → Alignment
Recovery loop: Alignment → Recovery → Alignment
```

See [`docs/motion-state-machine.md`](docs/motion-state-machine.md) for the full FSM with entry/exit conditions.

## Chaos Archetypes (5 Villains)

| Archetype | Verb | Counter-Skill | Behavior |
|-----------|------|---------------|----------|
| **Red Orbs** | disrupt | Anticipation | Drift within region, bounce at bounds |
| **Crushers** | constrain | Commitment | Fixed cycle: inactive → telegraph → active |
| **Drift Fields** | destabilize | Grip stability | Constant directional force |
| **Flickers** | mislead | Filtering | Flash → afterimage → invisible |
| **Locks** | restrict | Adaptability | Axis/speed constraints with telegraph |

Chaos never reacts to Trace. Chaos is deterministic, indifferent, mechanical.

See [`docs/chaos-behavior-state-machines.md`](docs/chaos-behavior-state-machines.md) and [`docs/interaction-rendering-canon.md`](docs/interaction-rendering-canon.md).

---

## Rendering

Trace's rendering is a pure function of state. No animation timelines, no sprite sheets.

```
VisualState = RenderProfile[MotionState]
```

Color-by-state drives everything: fill, edge, glow strength, directional bias, desaturation. The renderer expresses Trace's identity with zero animation assets.

See [`docs/renderer-integration-trace.md`](docs/renderer-integration-trace.md) and [`docs/visual-style-guide.md`](docs/visual-style-guide.md).

## Engine Heritage

Forked from [DeterministicMouseTrainingEngine](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/DeterministicMouseTrainingEngine). Core systems:

- `IGameSimulation` — pluggable game mode interface (2 methods)
- `DeterministicLoop` — 60Hz fixed timestep + alpha interpolation
- `DeterministicRng` — xorshift32, seed-reproducible
- `GameEvent` pipeline — typed event stream
- Replay system — MTR v1 binary format, FNV-1a verification
- Mutator composition — `LevelBlueprint` pure-function transforms
- Virtual coordinate space — 1920×1080, letterbox scaling

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build simulation library (0 warnings, TreatWarningsAsErrors)
dotnet build src/MouseTrainer.Simulation/

# Run all 340 tests
dotnet test tests/MouseTrainer.Tests/

# Run MAUI host (Windows — use Visual Studio, set startup to MauiHost)
```

## Key Design Principles

- **Determinism is constitutional.** Same seed → same simulation → same score, always. No `DateTime.Now`, no `Random`, no platform-dependent floats in the hot path.
- **Rendering is a pure function of state.** No animation timelines. MotionState + ForceVector + StabilityScalar → visual output.
- **Chaos is indifferent.** Obstacles never react to the player. They are systems, not enemies.
- **Mastery looks calm.** If high-skill play looks frantic, the system is lying.
- **Modular monolith.** Four assemblies with enforced one-way dependencies. Domain is the leaf; MauiHost is the only composition root.
- **Warnings are errors.** Library projects use `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`.
