# Soundscape Moodboard (Textual)

> A sensory guide to the world's sonic identity.
> This is not a spec. This is the feeling the soundscape should evoke.
> Use it to align intuition.

## I. Trace's Inner World

**The sound of intention**
A quiet hum, like a machine thinking without emotion.

**The sound of alignment**
Almost nothing.
A stillness that feels earned.

**The sound of commitment**
A subtle forward pressure — not speed, but direction.

**The sound of resistance**
A low, steady tension, like leaning into wind.

**The sound of correction**
Tiny, precise ticks — the sound of refinement.

**The sound of recovery**
A muted collapse, then clarity returning.

Trace's soundscape is the sound of discipline made audible.

## II. The System's Outer World

**Red Orbs — drifting interference**
Soft, airy noise that feels indifferent, not hostile.

**Crushers — mechanical inevitability**
A metronomic hum, like industrial machinery cycling.

**Drift Fields — directional pressure**
A smooth, low-frequency push, like a current.

**Flickers — perceptual noise**
Brief flashes of high-frequency static.

**Locks — constraint made audible**
A harmonic swell, then a clean clamp.

Chaos sounds like rules, not enemies.

## III. The Sound of Mastery

As the player improves:
- Trace becomes quieter
- Chaos becomes predictable
- The world becomes calmer

High-skill play should sound like:

**clarity, not triumph.**
**silence, not celebration.**
**control, not victory.**

## IV. The Emotional Tone (Without Emotion)

The soundscape should evoke:
- focus
- tension
- clarity
- discipline
- inevitability

But never:
- joy
- fear
- anger
- sadness
- excitement

This is a world of intent, not emotion.

## V. The Aesthetic Metaphor

If the visuals are "minimal neon metaphysics,"
the audio is:

**"a meditative machine learning to move."**

Not a robot.
Not a human.
Something in between — a being of motion.
