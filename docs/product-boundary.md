# Trace — Product Boundary

---

## What Trace Is

Trace is a deterministic cursor discipline game. The player navigates chaos through precision, not power. Every obstacle trains one skill. Mastery looks calm. The engine is deterministic — same seed, same run, same outcome.

Built on the Deterministic Mouse Training Engine (60Hz fixed timestep, alpha interpolation, virtual coordinate space, pluggable game modes).

## What Trace Is Not

- **Not an aim trainer.** No crosshairs, no flick shots, no FPS mechanics.
- **Not an arcade game.** No lives, no score chasing, no power-ups, no spectacle.
- **Not a power fantasy.** Trace never dominates chaos. Trace navigates it.
- **Not cute.** No exclamation marks, no emoji, no gamification language.

## Who It Is For

Anyone who wants to build real cursor discipline — anticipation, timing, stability, filtering, adaptability — through a system that respects their intelligence.

## Villain Roster (5 Archetypes)

| Villain | Verb | Counter-Skill |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Red Orbs | disrupt | Anticipation, calm motion |
| Crushers | constrain | Commitment, timing confidence |
| Drift Fields | destabilize | Grip stability, counterforce |
| Flickers | mislead | Filtering, visual discipline |
| Locks | restrict | Adaptive planning |

## Trace Skills (5 States)

| Skill | Effect | Tradeoff |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Focus | Reduce noise, dampen forces | Narrowed perception |
| Flow State | Reward smooth motion | Penalize stops |
| Anchor | Resist displacement | Slower movement |
| Pulse | Brief clarity spike | No mechanical advantage |
| Recovery | Partial slip correction | Very limited window |

## Consistency Contract

- **Legibility:** Every failure explainable in one sentence
- **Skill Alignment:** One obstacle, one skill, no overlap
- **No Power Fantasy:** Trace navigates, never dominates
- **Mastery Plateau:** Stability under pressure, speed is a side effect
- **Boring Is Good:** High-skill play looks calm
- **Sandbox First:** Every idea tested in isolation before integration

## Engine Heritage

Forked from [DeterministicMouseTrainingEngine](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/DeterministicMouseTrainingEngine). Shares:

- `IGameSimulation` pluggable mode interface
- `DeterministicLoop` (60Hz fixed timestep + alpha interpolation)
- `DeterministicRng` (xorshift32, seed-reproducible)
- `GameEvent` pipeline
- Replay system (MTR v1 binary format, FNV-1a verification)
- Mutator composition (`LevelBlueprint` pure-function transforms)
- Virtual coordinate space (1920x1080, letterbox scaling)

## Deferred

- Progression / unlock systems
- Leaderboards / social
- Additional villain types beyond the core 5
- Additional skill types beyond the core 5
- Mouse trainer integration (carry gamification back to MouseTrainer once Trace ships)
