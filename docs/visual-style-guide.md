# Trace Visual Style Guide

> Canonical visual identity of Trace and the world.
> How Trace looks, how Trace reads, how the world communicates discipline, chaos, and control.

## I. Trace's Visual Identity

### 1. Form

Trace is a minimal orb — not a sphere with texture, not a character with features.

- Perfect circle
- No face, no markings, no decoration

Trace is defined by motion, not appearance.

### 2. Core Visual Properties

#### A. Fill

- Soft, uniform, matte
- No gradients, no shine, no texture
- Intentional, not ornamental

#### B. Edge

- Crisp
- High contrast against background
- No glow by default

#### C. Scale

- Small enough to feel agile
- Large enough to read under pressure

### 3. Color Language

Trace's color communicates state, not personality.

| State | Color Behavior |
|-------|---------------|
| **Default** | Cool, neutral tone (soft white, pale blue, or desaturated cyan) |
| **Alignment** | Stable, consistent color. No flicker. |
| **Correction** | Slight, momentary edge brightening |
| **Commitment** | Subtle forward-facing gradient shift (barely perceptible) |
| **Resistance** | Slight directional dim on force side, slight brightening on counterforce side |
| **Recovery** | Brief desaturation, quick return to baseline |
| **Perfect Stability** (optional) | Faint, minimal halo. Never pulsing, never animated. |

## II. World Visual Identity

### 1. Background

The world is a hostile system, not a landscape.

- Minimal
- Abstract
- High readability
- No texture noise
- No decorative elements

A calm, neutral plane where motion is the only drama.

### 2. Obstacles (Chaos Archetypes)

Each villain archetype has a single visual verb.

#### A. Red Orbs — Disruptors

- Soft red fill
- Smooth drift
- No eyes, no faces
- No pulsing
- No randomness in animation

**Visual Verb:** disrupt

#### B. Crushers — Binary Punishers

- Rectangular or bar-like
- High contrast
- Sharp edges
- Clear open/closed states

**Visual Verb:** constrain

#### C. Drift Fields — Entropy Zones

- Subtle directional texture or gradient
- Never noisy
- Never animated rapidly
- Force direction must be visually legible

**Visual Verb:** destabilize

#### D. Flickers — Deceptive Signals

- Brief flashes
- Ghost-like afterimages
- No collision
- No physical presence

**Visual Verb:** mislead

#### E. Locks — Control Denial

- Clear axis indicators
- Minimal iconography
- No animation except telegraph

**Visual Verb:** restrict

## III. Feedback Visuals

### Success

- Slight stabilization
- Subtle glow
- No celebration

### Failure

- Brief dim
- Micro-recoil
- No explosion
- No shake (except Crushers)

### Near-Miss

- Tiny edge highlight
- No sound spike
- No dramatic flash

## IV. Anti-Patterns (Never Allowed)

- Faces, eyes, mouths, emotes
- Bounces, squash/stretch
- Trails that look like "speed lines"
- Cartoon exaggeration
- Decorative particles
- Idle animations
- Pulsing glows
- Expressive wobble

Trace is not a mascot. Trace is a discipline.

## V. Designer Checklist

Before approving any visual:

- [ ] Does this reinforce control, not emotion?
- [ ] Is the shape minimal and intentional?
- [ ] Does the color communicate state, not personality?
- [ ] Does the obstacle express one verb?
- [ ] Does the world remain calm at high skill?
- [ ] Does this avoid all anti-patterns?

If any answer is "no," revise.
