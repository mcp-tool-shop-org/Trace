## I. Core Principles

These are the laws. Break them, and Trace stops being Trace.

### 1. Motion Is Thought

Trace does not speak emotions. Trace expresses internal state through micro-adjustments, path curvature, acceleration patterns, and stability under force. Movement is cognition.

### 2. No Extraneous Motion

Trace never wiggles, bounces, or flourishes. Every movement must have purpose, clarity, and restraint. If an animation looks decorative, remove it.

### 3. Smoothness Is Identity

Trace's default motion is continuous, fluid, low-frequency, and stable. Jitter only appears when the system destabilizes Trace — never as a stylistic choice.

### 4. Motion Reflects Discipline, Not Emotion

Trace does not "celebrate" or "panic." Trace aligns, corrects, commits, holds, and adapts. These are expressed through motion, not mood.

---

## II. Trace's Physical Identity

### Trace is a being of motion

Trace has no limbs, no face, no body language. Trace's "soul" is expressed through trajectory, acceleration, stability, correction, and resistance.

### Trace is defined by discipline

Trace's movement is intentional, minimal, precise, and calm.

### Trace never moves for decoration

Every motion must have purpose. Every adjustment must reflect internal logic.

---

## III. The Five Core Motion States

Every animation must map to one of these. No exceptions.

### 1. ALIGNMENT (Neutral State)

**Meaning:** Trace is stable, centered, and ready.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Smooth, even movement
- Minimal drift
- Slight forward bias (intent)
- No jitter

**Narrative:** "I am aligned."

**Usage:** Default state, transitions, calm traversal.

**Design Note:** Alignment is the baseline. Everything else is deviation.

---

### 2. CORRECTION (Micro-Adjustment State)

**Meaning:** Trace refines trajectory after detecting inefficiency.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Tiny, precise course changes
- Low amplitude
- No oscillation
- Immediate return to smoothness

**Narrative:** "I refine."

**Usage:** Near obstacles, after small errors, during precision tasks.

**Triggers:** Near-miss, slight drift, entering a narrow path.

**Design Note:** Correction is Trace's "thinking." It must feel intelligent, not reactive.

---

### 3. COMMITMENT (Decisive Motion State)

**Meaning:** Trace commits to a path or timing window.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Clean acceleration without jerk
- Straightened trajectory
- Reduced lateral noise
- No hesitation

**Narrative:** "I commit."

**Usage:** Passing Crushers, entering timing gates, choosing routes.

**Design Note:** Commitment is confidence expressed mechanically.

---

### 4. RESISTANCE (Counterforce State)

**Meaning:** Trace stabilizes against external forces.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Slight lean opposite force vector
- Smooth counter-acceleration
- Visible but controlled compensation
- No overcorrection

**Narrative:** "I hold against pressure."

**Usage:** Drift Fields, destabilizing zones, environmental pushes.

**Design Note:** Resistance is not struggle. It is discipline under pressure.

---

### 5. RECOVERY (Post-Slip State)

**Meaning:** Trace regains alignment after a minor destabilization.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Brief recoil
- Controlled deceleration
- Return to alignment curve
- No dramatic snapback

**Narrative:** "I correct."

**Usage:** After small collisions, jitter spikes, timing slips.

**Design Note:** Recovery is Trace's humility — mechanical, not emotional.

---

## IV. Motion Grammar (State Transition Rules)

These transitions define Trace's "thought process."

### Allowed Transitions

```
Alignment  -->  Commitment    (Trace chooses a path)
Commitment -->  Resistance    (the system pushes back)
Resistance -->  Correction    (Trace refines the counterforce)
Correction -->  Alignment     (stability is restored)
Alignment  -->  Recovery      (only after a slip)
Recovery   -->  Alignment     (always returns to baseline)
```

### Forbidden Transitions

| Forbidden | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Alignment --> Resistance | Must commit first |
| Commitment --> Recovery | Must resist first |
| Recovery --> Commitment | Must align first |

These rules maintain Trace's internal logic and prevent emotional or chaotic motion.

---

## V. Path Language

Trace's path is a visual signature.

### 1. Curves Over Angles

Trace never makes sharp turns unless forced. Curves express intention, calm, and mastery.

### 2. No Zig-Zagging

Zig-zags imply panic. Trace never panics.

### 3. Efficiency Over Speed

Trace's path is clean, minimal, direct. Speed is a byproduct, not a goal.

### 4. Path Tension

Under pressure, Trace's curves tighten — reduced curvature, increased precision, visible discipline.

### 5. Path Release

After danger, Trace relaxes curvature slightly. This is the closest Trace gets to "relief."

## VI. Force Response Language

How Trace reacts to external forces defines the feel of the world.

| Force Type | Response |
|------------|----------|
| **Linear** | Lean opposite the force vector |
| **Rotational** | Arc into alignment, never snap |
| **Sudden** | Micro-recoil, immediate correction, return to alignment |
| **Persistent** | Constant counterforce curve |

---

## VII. Expressive Micro-Behaviors

Subtle cues that give Trace identity without emotion.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pre-Commit Stillness** | Brief moment of stillness before decisive motion |
| **Post-Correction Settling** | Tiny easing motion after correcting |
| **Drift Anticipation** | Subtle lean before entering a Drift Field |
| **Path Preview** | Motion slightly biases toward intended direction before moving |
| **Stability Glow** (optional) | Faint, non-aesthetic glow when perfectly aligned |

---

## VIII. Environmental Interaction Rules

1. **Obstacles influence Trace, not vice versa.** Trace never pushes, bumps, or affects obstacles.
2. **Trace never bounces off anything.** Recoil is minimal and controlled.
3. **Trace never stops dead.** Even in failure, motion decays smoothly.
4. **Trace never teleports.** All transitions must be physically continuous.

---

## IX. Failure Animation Rules

Failure is not drama. Failure is data.

**Motion:** Slight dimming, micro-recoil, slow drift to stillness. No explosion, no shake, no flash.

**Language:** "I lost alignment." / "My timing slipped." / "I hesitated."

---

## X. Success Animation Rules

Success is not celebration. Success is clarity.

**Motion:** Slight stabilization, faint glow, smooth deceleration, return to alignment.

**Language:** "The path was clean." / "Control held." / "Alignment achieved."

---

## XI. Anti-Patterns (Never Allowed)

These break Trace's identity and must be rejected immediately:

- Bounce
- Wobble
- Squash/stretch
- Expressive wiggles
- Celebratory spins
- Idle animations
- Frantic jitter
- Rubber-banding
- Comedic recoil
- Exaggerated anticipation

Trace is not a mascot. Trace is a discipline.

---

## XII. Animation QA Checklist

Before approving any animation:

- [ ] Does this motion express discipline, not emotion?
- [ ] Does it map to one of the five motion states?
- [ ] Does it follow the motion grammar?
- [ ] Does it avoid all anti-patterns?
- [ ] Does it reinforce Trace's identity as a being of control?
- [ ] Does mastery make the motion calmer, not flashier?
- [ ] Does the animation feel like thought, not flair?

If any answer is "no," revise.

## XIII. What This Spec Enables

- A protagonist defined by motion, not aesthetics
- A world where narrative and mechanics are unified
- A premium, minimalist identity
- A consistent experience across modes and expansions
- A foundation for future characters and systems

This is the motion language that makes Trace feel alive — not through emotion, but through precision, intent, and restraint.
