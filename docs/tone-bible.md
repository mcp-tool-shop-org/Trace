# Trace — Tone Bible

> Non-negotiable voice, animation, and design tone for all surfaces.
> If a line, animation, or mechanic violates these principles, it does not belong.

## I. Core Tone Principles

### 1. Mechanical, Not Emotional

Trace does not feel. Trace registers, evaluates, corrects.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I drifted." | "I'm scared." |
| "The system resisted." | "That was close!" |
| "My motion was wasteful." | "I'm frustrated." |

### 2. Intent Over Personality

Trace is defined by purpose, not charm.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I commit." | "Let's try again!" |
| "I hold." | "Oops!" |
| "I adapt." | "Nice!" |

### 3. Reflection Over Reaction

Trace does not react in the moment. Trace reflects after the moment.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "My timing was late." | "Whoa!" |
| "I overcorrected." | "Yikes!" |
| "The path was clean." | "That was wild!" |

### 4. Calm Under Pressure

Even in chaos, Trace's tone is steady.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "Noise increases. I remain." | "Everything's going crazy!" |
| "Disruption detected. I adjust." | "This is too much!" |

### 5. Precision as Identity

Trace is not trying to be precise. Trace is precision.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I align." | "I hope this works." |
| "I refine." | "Let me try to be careful." |
| "I maintain control." | |

## II. Voice Rules — All Text Surfaces

### 1. Short, Declarative Sentences

Never more than 6-8 words. Never compound sentences.

- "I correct."
- "The system shifts."
- "My path holds."

### 2. No Metaphors, No Poetry

Trace speaks literally, not symbolically.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "Force increases." | "The wind pushes me astray." |
| "Trajectory unstable." | "Chaos swirls around me." |

### 3. No Questions

Trace does not wonder. Trace observes.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "Uncertainty rises." | "What is happening?" |
| "Signal unclear." | "Why did that fail?" |

### 4. No Direct Address

Trace never speaks to the player. Trace speaks as the player.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I commit." | "You must be careful." |
| "I adjust." | "Try again." |

### 5. No Emotion Words

No fear, joy, anger, sadness.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "Instability detected." | "I'm nervous." |
| "I regain alignment." | "I'm relieved." |

## III. Animation Tone

### 1. Motion Is Meaning

Trace expresses through movement, not facial expression.

- Micro-corrections = thought
- Smooth arcs = confidence
- Jitter = instability
- Slight lean = anticipation
- Recoil = recognition of error

### 2. No Cartoon Physics

No squash/stretch, no bounce, no wobble. Movements should be smooth, intentional, minimal, physically grounded.

### 3. No Exaggeration

Trace never flails, jerks, or panics. If an animation looks dramatic, it's wrong.

### 4. Feedback Is Subtle

- **Success:** slight glow, slight stabilization
- **Failure:** brief dim, slight recoil
- Never fireworks, never screen shake (except Crushers)

---

## IV. Obstacle Tone

### 1. Obstacles Are Systems, Not Characters

They do not emote. They do not taunt. They do not "want" anything. They simply behave.

### 2. Every Obstacle Has a Single Verb

| Obstacle | Verb |
|----------|------|
| Red Orbs | disrupt |
| Crushers | constrain |
| Drift Fields | destabilize |
| Flickers | mislead |
| Locks | restrict |

If an obstacle does more than one verb, it's wrong.

### 3. No Malice

Red Orbs are not evil. Crushers are not angry. Drift Fields are not hostile. They are expressions of chaos, not antagonists.

---

## V. UI Tone

### 1. Minimal, Sparse, Quiet

UI should feel like instrumentation, not decoration.

### 2. No Exclamation Marks

Ever.

### 3. No Color Noise

Use color only to indicate: stability, instability, danger, clarity.

### 4. No Gamification Language

| Never | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Great job!" | "Clean." |
| "Try again!" | "Misaligned." |
| "Level up!" | "Stable." |
| | "Corrected." |

---

## VI. Failure Tone

Failure is not shame. Failure is data.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "I lost alignment." | "I failed." |
| "My timing slipped." | "That was bad." |
| "I hesitated." | "I can't do this." |

---

## VII. Success Tone

Success is not celebration. Success is clarity.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| "The path was clean." | "Nice!" |
| "Control held." | "You did it!" |
| "Alignment achieved." | "Perfect!" |

## VIII. Designer Checklist

Before shipping any line, animation, or mechanic:

- [ ] Does this express intent, not emotion?
- [ ] Is the language short, literal, and reflective?
- [ ] Does the obstacle train one skill?
- [ ] Does the feedback reinforce Trace's discipline, not the player's ego?
- [ ] Does mastery look calm, not flashy?
- [ ] Does this preserve the philosophical, mechanical tone of the world?

If any answer is "no," revise.

## IX. What This Tone Achieves

- A world that feels coherent and adult
- A protagonist who feels philosophical, not cute
- A narrative that reinforces mechanics
- A training tool that feels like a journey, not a chore
- A brand identity that is premium, minimal, and memorable

This is the tone that makes Trace work.
